👋 Hi, I’m @Shubham!
👀 I have a love triangle with novels, coding, and music (and no, they don’t know about each other).
🌱 Currently planting seeds of knowledge in Flutter and Rust—hoping for a fruitful harvest.
💞️ Looking to collaborate on Flutter. Bonus points if there’s coffee involved.
📫 How to reach me? Easy: heymyselfshubham@gmail.com—but don’t email me asking for free pizza.
😄 Pronouns: He/him...but will also answer to "Hey, coder!"
⚡ Fun fact: You probably skipped to this part, didn’t you? Gotcha! 😛
